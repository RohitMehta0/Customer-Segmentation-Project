# Customer-Segmentation-Project

Unsupervised Learning is a machine learning field that has been subject of many papers and projects. It deals with algorithms that learn from data without the need of labels. One interesting UL application in business is Customer Segmentation, which allows decision makers to understand more their brand’s customers and how to apply this knowledge in a data-driven way. 

Here we have a project that deals with CS using only data related to purchase patterns, specifically products’ categories. There was some preprocessing (normalization and outliers removal) and the application of Principal Components Analysis technique for dimensionality reduction.  Finally, KMeans clustering algorithm was applied and the final result was obtained.

This project was formerly presented to Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree and it was approved as it is presented here.
